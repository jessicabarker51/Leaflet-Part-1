Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
2-BasicMap



Used USGS site for json file on earthquakes over 30 days. 

Used Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Used data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
